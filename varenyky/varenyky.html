        Varenyky are traditional Ukrainian dumplings with a variety of fillings from
        sweet like cherries to sour like Sauerkraut. Each Ukrainian host has an own
        recipe of varenyky, but the cooking method stays the same: wrapping
        unleavened dough around the filling. Even Nikolai Gogol wrote about the dish,
        carrying a useful tip throughout the centuries: don’t forget to serve sour
        cream and dip varenyky in it before eating.

        <li>
            Wash and peel the potatoes, wash once again. Cut in large pieces. Put the potatoes in a saucepan and pour it
            with cold water, add salt and put on medium heat. Bring the water to a boil, then reduce the heat and cook
            until ready for about 26 minutes. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Peel the onion and cut in cubes. Preheat the frying pan with vegetable oil and fry the onion on medium heat
            until golden for about 5 minutes, occasionally stirring with a spatula.
         </li>
        <li>
            Drain the water from boiled potatoes. Add butter, a third part of the fried onions and blend the potatoes.
            Add salt, pepper to taste and mix thoroughly with a spoon. Put the filling in a plate and leave to cool off.
        </li>
        <li>
            Pour kefir and soda into a separate bowl, add salt and mix thoroughly. Then add the flour by half a glass
            each time, carefully mixing with a spoon. Spread the dough on the processing board for kneading and knead
            until homogeneous. It shouldn't stick to hands.

        </li>
        <li>
            Cut off a 2cm dough strip and cut it into cubes on the processing board. Mash the cubes in flour on both
            sides and roll out with a rolling pin.
        </li>
        <li>
            Put the potato filling in the middle of the circle of dough and pinch the edges. Put dumplings on a
            processing board sprinkled with flour, so that they do not stick to the surface. The dough is enough for
            about 25 varenyky. You can freeze dumplings in a freezer and cook them later.
        </li>
        <li>
            Pour cold water in a saucepan, salt to taste and boil on high heat. Put the dumplings in boiling water,
            moving them with a spatula so that they do not stick to the bottom of the pan. Leave to cook on medium heat.
            Remove the heat in 2-3 minutes after the dumplings pop up on the surface. Dry the water, put varenyky in a
            bowl. Mix with the rest of the fried onion. Serve hot with sour cream.
