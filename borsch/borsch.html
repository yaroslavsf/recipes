    <h1>The borsch's recipe</h1>
    <img src="borsch.jpeg">
    <p>Borscht (English: /ˈbɔːrʃ, ˈbɔːrʃt/ ) is a sour soup common in Eastern<br> 
        Europe and Northern Asia. In English, the word "borscht" is most often<br>
        associated with the soup's variant of Ukrainian origin, made with red<br>
        beetroots as one of the main ingredients, which give the dish its<br>
        distinctive red color.

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) package pork sausage</li>
        <li>3 medium beets, peeled and shredded</li>
        <li>3 carrots, peeled and shredded</li>
        <li>3 medium baking potatoes, peeled and cubed</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>¾ cup water</li>
        <li>1 (6 ounce) can tomato paste</li>
        <li>½ cup sour cream, for topping</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley for garnish</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps to cook:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Crumble the sausage (if using) into a skillet over medium-high heat.<br>
            Cook and stir until no longer pink. Remove from the heat and set aside.<br>
        </li>
        <li>
            Fill a large pot halfway with water(about 2 quarts), and bring to a <br>
            boil. Add the sausage, and cover the pot. Return to a boil. Add the beets,<br>
            and cook until they have lost their color. Add the carrots and potatoes, <br>
            and cook until tender, about 15 minutes. Add the cabbage, and the can of <br>
            diced tomatoes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Heat the oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add the onion, and cook until <br>
            tender. Stir in the tomato paste and water until well blended. Transfer to <br>
            the pot. Add the raw garlic to the soup, cover and turn off the heat. <br>
            Let stand for 5 minutes. Taste, and season with salt, pepper and sugar.
        </li>
        <li>
            Ladle into serving bowls, and garnish with sour cream, if desired, and fresh<br> 
            parsley.
        </li>
    </ol>
